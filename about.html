      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm <strong>AC</strong>, a dedicated web developer with a strong passion for creating sleek, responsive, and accessible websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend frameworks. With every project, my goal is to write clean code, craft intuitive UI, and deliver seamless user experiences.</p>

      <p>I started my coding journey with curiosity for mindbreaking logics. Over time, I’ve built personal projects, and constantly sharpened my skills to stay current with new trends and technologies.</p>

      <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy learning about things that i don't know, going to different churches, 
        and experiencing different kinds of culture here in the Philippines. I believe in continuous growth, and I’m always up for a challenge that helps me improve as a better human being.</p>
