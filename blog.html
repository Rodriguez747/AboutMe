      <h1>Inside the Mind of <span>AC</span></h1>

      <p>Hello there! I'm AC — a curious soul navigating life with a controller in one hand and a frying pan in the other. While I may not be the most intelligent person in the room, I love to challenge the boundaries of my own logic and see just how far I can go.</p>

      <div class="blog-image">

        <p class="img-caption">Sunday reflections at church — my weekly reset.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Sundays hold a special place in my heart. There's something peaceful about attending church — a moment of pause, reflection, and grounding in a world that constantly moves fast.</p>

      <p>When I'm not exploring the digital realm or experimenting in the kitchen, you’ll probably find me doing what I love most: sleeping. Yes, sleep is my favorite escape — a simple pleasure, underrated but essential for recharging the mind and spirit.</p>

      <div class="blog-image">

        <p class="img-caption">Gaming: where creativity meets strategy.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Gaming is another passion of mine. Whether it’s strategy, action, or simulation, I love immersing myself in different worlds and learning how systems work. It’s more than just fun — it fuels creativity and critical thinking.</p>

      <p>And lastly, I find joy in cooking. There’s an art in blending flavors, a science in timing, and a reward in sharing meals with others. It’s one of the many ways I explore and express myself.</p>

      <div class="blog-image">

        <p class="img-caption">Cooking isn't just food — it's a form of expression.</p>
      </div>

      <p>So that’s me — not a genius, but someone who’s always eager to learn, grow, explore, and maybe burn a few dishes along the way.</p>
